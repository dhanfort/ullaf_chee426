QUESTION
What is a polymer?

ANSWER
Polymers, whether artificial (such as the plastic shown) or natural, are made of repeating chains of smaller chemical units. By definition, polymers are large molecules made by bonding (chemically linking) a series of building blocks. The word polymer comes from the Greek words for “many parts.” Each of those parts is scientists call a monomer (which in Greek means “one part”).

QUESTION
What is an isomer?

ANSWER
Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formulas, but different arrangements of atoms. There are several different types of isomers including conformational isomers, structural isomers, geometric isomers, optical isomers and stereoisomers. 

QUESTION
What is a conformational isomer?

ANSWER
Conformational isomers, also known as conformers, differ from one another by their rotation around a single bond. Rotations occur freely around single carbon-carbon bonds. Unlike double and triple bonds, which are "locked" in their orientation, single bonds have no such restrictions.

QUESTION
What is a structural isomer?

ANSWER
A structural isomer, also known as a constitutional isomer, is one in which two or more organic compounds have the same molecular formulas but different structures.

QUESTION
What is a stereoisomer?

ANSWER
Stereoisomers have the same connectivity in their atoms but a different arrangement in three-dimensional space. There are different classifications of stereoisomers depending on how the arrangements differ from one another. 

QUESTION
What is a geometric isomer?

ANSWER
Geometric isomers are isomers in which the order of atom bonding is the same but the arrangement of atoms in space is different. The double bond in an alkene is not free to rotate because of the nature of the bond. The cis isomer has the two single hydrogen atoms on the same side of the molecule, while the trans isomer has them on opposite sides of the molecule. In both molecules, the bonding order of the atoms is the same. In order for geometric isomers to exist, there must be a rigid structure in the molecule to prevent free rotation around a bond. This occurs with a double bond or a ring. In addition, the two carbon atoms must each have two different groups attached in order for there to be geometric isomers.

QUESTION
What is an optical isomer?

ANSWER
Stereoisomers that are not geometric isomers are known as optical isomers. Optical isomers differ in the placement of substituted groups around one or more atoms of the molecule. They were given their name because of their interactions with plane-polarized light. Optical isomers are labeled enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomers are non-mirror image optical isomers. Diastereomers have a different arrangement around one or more atoms while some of the atoms have the same arrangement. Epimers are a sub-group of diastereomers that differ at only one location.

QUESTION
What are the types of polymers?

ANSWER
There are several types of polymers; however, the main classifications of polymers include thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers.

QUESTION
What is a thermoplastic?

ANSWER
Thermoplastics are defined as polymers that can be melted and recast almost indefinitely.  They are molten when heated and harden upon cooling. These characteristics, which lend the material its name, are reversible so that it can be reheated, reshaped, and frozen repeatedly. As a result, thermoplastics are mechanically recyclable. Some of the most common types of thermoplastics are polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate.

QUESTION
What is a thermoset?

ANSWER
A thermosetting plastic is a polymer that irreversibly becomes rigid when heated. Initially, the polymer is a liquid or soft solid. Heat provides energy for chemical reactions that increase the cross-linking between polymer chains, curing the plastic. The rate of curing may be increased in many cases by increasing pressure or by adding a catalyst.

QUESTION
What is an elastomer?

ANSWER
An elastomer is a polymer that exhibits viscoelasticity and properties that include viscosity as well as elastic. A elastomer is made up of polymers linked by chemical bonds, with a crossed-linked form. Without the cross-linkages, applied stress to an elastomer could cause permanent deformation. This is why the material is distinguished by its an extremely high elongation and flexibility and elasticity. This can prevent the material from snapping, cracking, or breaking when it is deformed.

QUESTION
What is glass transition temperature?

ANSWER
The glass transition temperature (Tg) is a phenomenon of amorphous polymers. At this temperature, polymers undergo a transition from glassy to rubbery state. Tg is an important feature of polymer behavior. It marks a region of dramatic changes in the physical and mechanical properties. Below the glass transition temperature, due to lack of mobility, the polymers are hard and brittle like glass. Above the glass transition temperature, the polymers are soft and flexible like rubber.

QUESTION
What is an amorphous solid?

ANSWER
Amorphous polymers have a random molecular structure. At Tg, they take the glassy-state properties like brittleness, stiffness, and rigidity (upon cooling). They have a lower Tg than semi-crystalline polymers. This is because their polymeric chains are physically entangled and have spaces between them or at the chain ends. This space is known as free volume which helps polymer chains to move at low temperatures. Higher the free volume lower the glass transition temperature. They do not have a sharp melting point. As temperature rises the amorphous material softens. These materials are more sensitive to stress failure due to the presence of hydrocarbons.

QUESTION
What are crystalline polymers?

ANSWER
Crystalline polymers have a highly ordered molecular structure. They do not soften as the temperature rises, but rather have a defined and narrow melting point (Tm). This melting point is generally above the upper range of amorphous thermoplastics.

QUESTION
What is osmosis?

ANSWER
Osmosis is the ability of a solvent (usually water) to pass from a dilute solution (or pure solvent) on one side of a membrane to a more concentrated solution of the other side of the membrane.

QUESTION
What is osmotic pressure?

ANSWER
Osmotic pressure is the pressure required to prevent osmotic motion from occurring.

QUESTION
What is the difference between a Newtonian and a non-newtonian fluid?

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of atomic weight. 
ANSWER: The ratio of the average mass of an atom of an element to the mass of some chosen standard is called the atomic weight or relative atomic mass Ar of that element (the r stands for “relative”). The standard used since 1961 is times one-twelfth the mass of the isotope Carbon 12. The atomic weight of Carbon 12  is thus exactly 12, by definition.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of average molecular weight? 
ANSWER: The ratio of the average mass of a molecule of a substance to times one-twelfth the mass of a Carbon 12 atom is called the molecular weight or relative molecular mass (Mr) of that substance. We say “on the average” to acknowledge the existence of naturally occurring isotopes of all elements. Since atomic and molecular weights are relative masses, these “weights” are dimensionless numbers. This term is analogous to idea of molar mass. 

QUESTION: Describe your understanding Avogadro’s number? 
ANSWER: Avogadro’s number is the number of Carbon 12 atoms in exactly 12 grams of Carbon 12. Avogadro’s experiment gives 6.02 *10^23 as the number of Carbon 12 atoms per 12 grams of Carbon 12 atoms. Avogadro constant (6.02 *10^23 mol^-1) serves as a conversion factor for moles of a substance to the number of molecules or atoms. 

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of a mole? 
ANSWER: A mole of some substance is defined as an amount of that substance which contains Avogadro’s number of elementary entities.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding Boyle’s Law. 
ANSWER: Boyle’s Law describes a relation between the pressure and volume of gases. Boyle’s law states that, for a fixed amount of gas kept at a fixed temperature, P and V are inversely proportional. Careful investigation shows that Boyle’s law holds only approximately for real gases, with deviations from the law approaching zero in the limit of zero pressure. The pressure exerted by the gas is due to the impacts of the molecules on the walls. A decrease in volume causes the molecules to hit the walls more often, thereby increasing the pressure. Boyle’s law is of the form: P*V = k (at constant T, m). 

QUESTION: Describe your understanding Charles’ Law. 
ANSWER: Charles (1787) and Gay-Lussac (1802) measured the thermal expansion of gases and found a linear increase in volume with temperature at constant pressure and fixed amount of gas. The molecular explanation for Charles’ law lies in the fact that an increase in temperature means the molecules are moving faster and hitting the walls harder and more often. Therefore, the volume must increase if the pressure is to remain constant. Charles’ law is obeyed most accurately in the limit of zero pressure. Charles’ law is of the form: V = a1 + a2 (at constant P, m). 

QUESTION: Describe your understanding Ideal Gas Law. 
ANSWER: The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law. The ideal gas law is often written in an empirical form:
pV=nRT, where p V and T are the pressure, volume and temperature respectively; n is the amount of substance; and R is the ideal gas constant. 
It can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Krönig in 1856[2] and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding Equations of State and Phase Equilibrium. 
ANSWER: Experiments generally show the thermodynamic state of a homogeneous system with a fixed composition to be specified when the two variables P and T are specified. If the thermodynamic state is specified, this means the volume V of the system is specified. Given values of P and T of a fixed-composition system, the value of V is determined. But this is exactly what is meant by the statement that V is a function of P and T. Therefore, V = u(P, T), where u is a function that depends on the nature of the system. If the restriction of fixed composition is dropped, the state of the system will depend on its composition as well as on P and T. We then have V = f (P, T, n1, n2, . . .) where n1, n2, . . . are the numbers of moles of substances 1, 2, . . . in the homogeneous system and f is some function. This relation between P, T, n1, n2, . . . , and V is called a volumetric equation of state, or, more simply, an equation of state. If the system is heterogeneous, each phase will have its own equation of state. The laws of thermodynamics are general and cannot be used to deduce equations of state for particular systems. Equations of state must be determined experimentally. One can also use statistical mechanics to deduce an approximate equation of state starting from some assumed form for the intermolecular interactions in the system. All models for describing Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium, Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium, or Vapor-Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium can be placed into two categories: 1) Activity/Fugacity coefficient models (γ−φ models) 2) Equation of State Models (essentially φ−φ models)

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of standard enthalpy. 
ANSWER: The standard enthalpy of formation (or standard heat of formation) delta H_f ° T of a pure substance at temperature T is delta H° for the process in which one mole of the substance in its standard state at T is formed from the corresponding separated elements at T, each element being in its reference form. The reference form (or reference phase) of an element at temperature T is usually taken as the form of the element that is most stable at T and 1-bar pressure

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of standard state. 
ANSWER: The standard state of a pure substance is defined as follows. For a pure solid or a pure liquid, the standard state is defined as the state with pressure P 1 bar [Eq. (1.11)] and temperature T, where T is some temperature of interest. Thus for each value of T there is a single standard state for a pure substance. The symbol for a standard state is a degree superscript (read as “naught,” “zero,” or “standard”), with the temperature written as a subscript.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of standard state Gibbs energy (change). 
ANSWER: The standard Gibbs energy (change) delta G° T for a chemical reaction is the change in G for converting stoichiometric numbers of moles of the separated pure reactants, each in its standard state at T, into the separated pure products in their standard states at T. Similar to deltaH° T = sigma nu_i * H° m,T,i. We have delta G° T = aSigma_i niG° m,T,I. If the reaction is one of formation of a substance from its elements in their reference forms, then delta G° T is the standard Gibbs energy of formation delta fG° T of the substance. For an element in its reference form at T,  delta fG° T is zero, since formation of an element from itself is no change at all.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding group contribution to properties of gases. 
ANSWER: Bond additivity and bond-energy calculations usually give reasonable estimates of gas-phase enthalpy changes, but can be significantly in error. An improvement on bond additivity is the method of group contributions. Here, one estimates thermodynamic quantities as the sum of contributions from groups in the molecule. Corrections for ring strain and for certain nonbonded interactions (such as the repulsion between two methyl groups that are bonded to adjacent carbons and that are in a gauche conformation) are included. A group consists of an atom in the molecule together with the atoms bonded to it. However, an atom bonded to only one atom is not considered to produce a group.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of the chemical potential of pure gases. 
ANSWER: The chemical potential is an intensive property, so m for a pure gas depends on T and P only. Since reaction equilibrium is usually studied in systems held at constant temperature while the amounts and partial pressures of the reacting gases vary, we are most interested in the variation of m with pressure. The Gibbs equation for dG for a fixed amount of substance is dG = -SdT + V dP, and division by the number of moles of the pure ideal gas gives dG_m = dmu = -S_mu dT + V_m dP, since the chemical potential mu of a pure substance equals G_mu.

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of Chemical Equilibrium. 
ANSWER: The standard equilibrium constant K° P is the product and quotient of positive numbers and must therefore be positive: 0 < K°_P < infinity. If K°_P is very large (K°_P >> 1), its numerator must be much greater than its denominator, and this means that the equilibrium pressures of the products are usually greater than those of the reactants. Conversely, if K° P is very small (K°_P << 1), its denominator is large compared with its numerator and the reactant equilibrium pressures are usually larger than the product equilibrium pressures. A moderate value of K°_P usually means substantial equilibrium pressures of both products and reactants. (The word “usually” has been used because it is not the pressures that appear in the equilibrium constant but the pressures raised to the stoichiometric coefficients.) A large value of the equilibrium constant favors products; a small value favors reactants. For an ideal-gas reaction, once we know the value of K°_P at a given temperature, we can find the equilibrium composition of any given reaction mixture at that temperature and a specified pressure or volume. K°_P can be determined by chemical analysis of a single mixture that has reached equilibrium at the temperature of interest. However, it is generally simpler to determine K°_P from delta G°, using delta G° = -RT ln( K°_P).

QUESTION: Describe your understanding of the Phase Rule with no reactions.
ANSWER: To describe the equilibrium state of a system with several phases and several chemical species, we can specify the mole numbers of each species in each phase and the temperature and pressure, T and P. Provided no rigid or adiabatic walls separate phases, T and P are the same in all phases at equilibrium. Specifying mole numbers is not what we shall do, however, since the mass of each phase of the system is of no real interest. The mass or size of each phase does not affect the phase-equilibrium position, since the equilibrium position is determined by equality of chemical potentials, which are intensive variables. (For example, in a two-phase system consisting of an aqueous solution of NaCl and solid NaCl at fixed T and P, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved NaCl in the saturated solution is independent of the mass of each phase.) We shall therefore deal with the mole fractions of each species in each phase, rather than with the mole numbers. The number of degrees of freedom (or the variance) f of an equilibrium system is defined as the number of independent intensive variables needed to specify its intensive state. Specification of the intensive state of a system means specification of its thermodynamic state except for the sizes of the phases. The equilibrium intensive state is described by specifying the intensive variables P, T, and the mole fractions in each of the phases. As we shall see, these variables are not all independent. We initially make two assumptions, which will later be eliminated: (1) No chemical reactions occur. (2) Every chemical species is present in every phase. Let the number of different chemical species in the system be denoted by c, and let p be the number of phases present. From assumption 2, there are c chemical species in each phase and hence a total of pc mole fractions. Adding in T and P, we have ,p*c+2, intensive variables to describe the intensive state of the equilibrium system. However, these pc + 2 variables are not all independent; there are relations between them. Therefore the number of independent intensive variables (which, by definition, is the number of degrees of freedom f ) f =  c - p + 2 (no reactions).

QUESTION:Describe your understanding of SURFACES AND NANOPARTICLES.
ANSWER: Molecules at the surface of a phase are in a different environment than those in the interior of the phase, and we now consider surface effects. Surface effects are of tremendous industrial and biological significance. Many reactions occur most readily on the surfaces of catalysts and heterogeneous catalysis is used to synthesize many industrial chemicals. Such subjects as lubrication, corrosion, adhesion, detergency, and electrochemical-cell reactions involve surface effects. Many industrial products are colloids with large surface areas. The problem of how biological cell membranes function belongs to surface science. The smaller an object is, the greater is the percentage of atoms (or molecules) at the surface. The number of atoms along an edge of the cube is and is shown at the top of the figure. For a metal atom with a diameter of 0.3 nm, the values and correspond to edge lengths of 3 nm and 30 nm, respectively. The atoms or molecules in the interior of a solid or liquid feel the attractions of nearby atoms or molecules on all sides, but atoms or molecules at the surface experience fewer attractions and so are less tightly bound than those in the interior. Therefore as the size of a solid nanoparticle decreases, the increasing fraction of atoms at the surface produces a decrease in melting point and a decrease in the enthalpy of melting.

Question: Describe your understanding of “conductive heat transfer”. 
Answer: When a temperature gradient exists in a body, experience has shown that there is an energy transfer from the high-temperature region to the low-temperature region. We say that the energy is transferred by conduction and that the heat-transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient, this also called Fourier’s law. 

Question: Describe your understanding of “thermal conductivity”.
Answer: The thermal conductivity of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. It is commonly denoted by k, lamba, or kappa. For gases at moderately low temperatures, analytical treatments in the kinetic theory of gases may be used to predict accurately the experimentally observed values. In some cases, theories are available for the prediction of thermal conductivities in liquids and solids, but in general, many open questions and concepts still need clarification where liquids and solids are concerned. The mechanism of thermal conduction in a gas is a simple one. We identify the kinetic energy of a molecule with its temperature; thus, in a high-temperature region, the molecules have higher velocities than in some lower-temperature region. The molecules are in continuous random motion, colliding with one another and exchanging energy and momentum. The molecules have this random motion whether or not a temperature gradient exists in the gas. If a molecule moves from a high-temperature region to a region of lower temperature, it transports kinetic energy to the lower-temperature part of the system and gives up this energy through collisions with lower-energy molecules. In general, the thermal conductivity is strongly temperature-dependent

Question: Describe your understanding of “convection heat transfer”.
Answer: To express the overall effect of convection, we use Newton’s law of cooling: q = hA (Tw − T∞) Here the heat-transfer rate is related to the overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid and the surface area A. The quantity h is called the convection heat-transfer coefficient. An analytical calculation of h may be made for some systems. For complex situations it must be determined experimentally. The heat-transfer coefficient is sometimes called the film conductance because of its relation to the conduction process in the thin stationary layer of fluid at the wall surface. We note that the units of h are in watts per square meter per Celsius degree when the heat flow is in watts.

Question: Describe your understanding of the difference between “natural convection” and “forced convection” 
Answer: If a heated plate were exposed to ambient room air without an external source of motion, a movement of the air would be experienced as a result of the density gradients near the plate. We call this natural, or free, convection as opposed to forced convection, which is experienced in the case of the fan blowing air over a plate. Boiling and condensation phenomena are also grouped under the general subject of convection heat transfer.

Question:  
Discuss how the incorporation of specific chemical carriers into immobilized liquid films can improve the selectivity of membrane systems towards certain components of a mixture.  

Answer:  
The incorporation of specific chemical carriers into immobilized liquid films can significantly enhance the selectivity of membrane systems. These carriers are designed to react chemically with certain components of a mixture, increasing their concentration within the membrane. This augmented concentration creates a stronger concentration-difference driving force for the diffusion of the targeted component through the membrane. By selectively binding or reacting with certain molecules, these carriers can differentiate between similar substances, allowing the membrane system to selectively permit the passage of the desired component while rejecting others. This method offers a promising approach to improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of membrane-based separation processes, especially in applications where high selectivity is crucial.

Question:  
Explain the operational principle of Emulsion Liquid Membranes (ELMs) and their advantages over traditional separation methods.  

Answer:  
Emulsion Liquid Membranes (ELMs) operate on the principle of encapsulating a lean phase within a liquid membrane, which is then stabilized by surfactants. This setup creates a barrier that selectively allows the passage of certain substances while blocking others, based on the solubilities and diffusion coefficients of the substances in the membrane phase. The major advantage of ELMs over traditional separation methods is their ability to perform extraction and stripping simultaneously, within a single stage, leading to increased efficiency and reduced operational costs. Additionally, ELMs offer high selectivity and the potential for lower energy consumption, as they can operate under milder conditions compared to some traditional processes. Their unique operational principle makes them particularly suitable for applications where the selective separation of components is essential, such as in the recovery of valuable substances from complex mixturesor the purification of specific chemicals.

Question:  
Discuss the challenges and potential solutions for scaling up Facilitated Transport Membranes (FTMs) for industrial applications.  

Answer:  
Scaling up Facilitated Transport Membranes (FTMs) for industrial use presents several challenges, including maintaining membrane stability and integrity over time, ensuring the consistent availability and incorporation of specific chemical carriers, and addressing the cost-effectiveness of the overall process. Potential solutions to these challenges include the development of more robust membrane materials that can withstand long-term operational conditions, the synthesis of more efficient and selective carriers that can be produced at scale, and the design of membrane systems that optimize the contact between the membrane and the feed stream to enhance throughput and selectivity. Additionally, research into novel fabrication methods that can produce FTMs at lower costs and with higher durability can make these systems more appealing for large-scale industrial applications, particularly in sectors where high selectivity and efficiency are paramount.

Question:  
Examine the role of pore size and applied pressure in determining the flux and selectivity of Polymeric Membranes in separation processes.  

Answer:  
The pore size and applied pressure are critical factors in determining both the flux (the volume of permeate passing through a unit area of the membrane per unit time) and selectivity (the ability of the membrane to discriminate between different molecules or ions) of Polymeric Membranes in separation processes. Smaller pore sizes can lead to higher selectivity by allowing only molecules or ions of a specific size or smaller to pass through, effectively filtering out larger species. However, this can also result in lower flux due to increased resistance to flow through the membrane. Conversely, larger pore sizes can increase flux but may reduce selectivity, as a wider range of molecule sizes can pass through the membrane. Applied pressure can compensate for the reduced flux associated with smaller pore sizes by driving more fluid through the membrane, but there is a limit to how much pressure can be applied before it begins to damage the membrane structure or significantly increase operational costs. Optimizing these factors requires a balance that depends on the specific requirements of the separation process, including the desired purity of the permeate and the efficiency of the operation.

Question:  
How do environmental considerations impact the development and implementation of membrane technology for separation processes?  

Answer:  
Environmental considerations play a significant role in the development and implementation of membrane technology for separation processes. These considerations include the reduction of energy consumption, minimization of waste production, and the use of environmentally benign materials in membrane fabrication. Membrane technologies that require lower energy inputs for operation are highly desirable, as they contribute to the overall reduction of carbon emissions associated with industrial processes. Moreover, systems designed to minimize or recycle waste streams can help in reducing the environmental footprint of manufacturing and treatment operations. The selection of materials for membrane construction also requires careful consideration, with a preference for materials that are sustainable, recyclable, or derived from renewable resources to mitigate environmental impact. Furthermore, the long-term stability and the potential for membrane fouling need to be addressed to ensure that the use of membranes does not introduce secondary environmental issues, such as the disposal of fouled membranes or the need for frequent chemical cleaning. As environmental regulations become stricter and public awareness of environmental issues grows, the development of membrane technologies that align with these considerations will become increasingly important.

QUESTION:
Define activation energy.

ANSWER:
The minimum energy required to activate one mole of a substance to cause a chemical reaction to take place. For a chemical reaction to proceed, the reactants are converted to products in which the energy increases to a maximum and falls to the energy of the products. The activation energy is the difference between the maximum energy and the energy of the reactants and is therefore the energy than needs to be overcome.

ANSWER:
A process in which components in gases, liquids, or dissolved substances are selectively held on the surface of a solid. It is used to remove components that may otherwise be harmful if released into the environment or may cause process difficulties further downstream such as causing the poisoning of a catalyst. Adsorption usually takes place in fixed beds.

QUESTION:
Define advection.

ANSWER:
The natural movement of a fluid such as air resulting in horizontal motion caused by local pressure differences. It differs from * convection since it does not include the effects of diffusion.

QUESTION:
Discuss your understanding of air pollution.

ANSWER:
The release of particles, vapours, and gases into the environment that are harmful to human health and to the environment such as plants, forests, and animals. Carbon dioxide is a product from the combustion of fossil fuels in power stations, vehicles, aeroplanes, and numerous industrial processes, and is a greenhouse gas responsible for contributing to the warming of the Earth�s atmosphere. Methane is another greenhouse gas as are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were once widely used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants but are now banned due to their known damaging effect on the Earth�s ozone layer. Sulphur dioxide is another product of the combustion of fossil fuels and is known as the cause of * acid rain . In the UK, an Act of Parliament was introduced in 1956 to reduce the level of air pollution. It was a landmark in environmental protection and was responsible for reducing the level of smoke pollution as well as sulphur dioxide emitted into the environment. In the US, the Clean Air Act introduced in 1963, together with its subsequent amendments as a federal law, has been responsible for controlling air pollution. Other governments have also taken measures to control air pollution and limit the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement between countries to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide emissions and restrict or ban the emission of certain chemicals such as CFCs. One way of restricting carbon dioxide emissions is to raise the level of taxation on fuels so that people and industrial companies have greater incentives to conserve energy and pollute less.

QUESTION:
What is annular flow?

ANSWER:
A two-phase flow regime of a gas and a liquid in a vertical pipe or tube characterized by a continuous gas core with a wall film of liquid. The flow regime occurs at high gas velocities compared with the liquid. There is often a simultaneous flow of the liquid phase entrained in the gas as a fine dispersion of droplets. In horizontal pipes, the effect of gravity causes the film to become thicker on the bottom of the pipe. As the gas velocity is increased, the film becomes more uniform around the circumference.

QUESTION:
What is Archimedes� principle?

ANSWER:
A principle that states when a body floats it displaces a weight of liquid equal to its own weight. The principle was not stated by Archimedes but is connected to his discoveries in hydrostatics. When a body is partially or totally immersed in a liquid, there is an upthrust on the body equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the body.

QUESTION:
What is an emulsion?

ANSWER:
A colloidal suspension of one liquid dispersed within another. The dispersed phase has droplet sizes usually less than 1 mm. Butter is an example of a water-in-oil emulsion, while mayonnaise is an example of an oil-in-water emulsion. Surfactants or emulsifiers are surface-active agents and used to stabilize emulsions. Detergents possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts to their molecules to behave as emulsifiers. In the offshore oil industry, emulsions form at the interface of water and oil in crude oil gravity separators. Sufficient hold-up time is used to separate the emulsion, or alternatively, surface-active agents are used to encourage separation.

QUESTION:
What is emulsification?

ANSWER:
The dispersion of two immiscible phases within one another. The emulsification of foods is one of the most complicated unit operations since the nature of the final product varies greatly depending on the method of preparation. The method of addition of components and the rate of addition can significantly affect the emulsion quality. Oil-in-water emulsions can be produced in impeller-agitated vessels operating at high rotational speeds, colloidal mills, or high-pressure valve homogenizers. Continuous processing may be achieved by * in-line mixers , which consist of a high-speed rotor inside a casing, into which the components are pumped and subjected to high shear.

QUESTION:
What is entrainment?

ANSWER:
The capture of bubbles, drops, or particles from one phase to another from which it is being separated.

QUESTION:
What is an evaporator?

ANSWER:
A heat exchanger device used to concentrate a solution by boiling. The solution is heated until vapour is released and removed, leaving behind a more concentrated solution. A drying process may then follow evaporation and low pressures may be used for heat-sensitive materials such as milk and other thermally labile foods. Several evaporators or �effects� can be connected in series as a * cascade process to obtain a desired evaporation with the benefit of good energy utilization. They may be operated as feed-forward or feedbackward. Cold feeds use a backward process because the boiling temperature in the last effect is lower and consequently the required temperature for evaporation is less than that required in the first evaporator.

QUESTION:
What is feedback control?

ANSWER:
A closed-loop method of controlling a process in which information about the controlled variable is fed back to the input and compared against a desired value. The difference between the two signals is called the error or deviation . The feedback can be accomplished by a human operator as in manual control, or by the use of instruments as in automatic control. In a negative feedback control, the applied counteracting disturbance is motivated by the difference between the desired value and the actual value of the controlled variable. For example, in the manual control of the heating of a liquid in a vessel with steam, an operator periodically measures the temperature of the liquid; if this temperature is below the desired value, the steam flow is increased by opening the valve slightly. In the automatic control of the vessel, a temperature-sensitive device is used to produce a signal, which may be electrical or pneumatic, and is proportional to the measured temperature. This signal is fed to a controller, which compares it with some desired value or set point. Where there is a difference in signals, the controller changes the opening of the steam control valve to adjust the temperature.

QUESTION:
What is feedforward control?

ANSWER:
A method of process control in which a disturbance is detected before it enters the system for which the controller calculates the required counter-acting disturbance. Process disturbances are measured and compensated for without waiting for a change in the controlled variable to indicate that a disturbance has occurred. Feedforward control is useful where the final controlled variable is not able to be measured. The necessary equations are solved by the controller relating all the process variables, such as steam flow, liquid output temperature, etc., which are usually designated as the process model. Perfect models and controllers are rare so a combination of feedback and feedforward control is more desirable.

QUESTION:
What is flash evaporation/vaporization?

ANSWER:
The rapid separation of a saturated liquid of a single component into a vapour and a liquid when it passes through a throttling valve to a lower pressure. As a single-stage vapour�liquid separation process, the liquid mixture is partially vaporized by heating and reducing the pressure, allowing the vapour to form at the expense of the liquid adiabatically. The vapour is allowed to reach equilibrium with a residual liquid, and the resulting vapour and liquid phases are separated and removed. It may be operated as either a batch or continuous process. It is also known as equilibrium distillation. The process in which both the liquid and vapour are cooled to the saturation temperature of the liquid at the reduced pressure, which forms the basis of vapour compression cycles used for refrigeration. The flash process is isenthalpic since it involves no work, and is also known as an adiabatic flash.

QUESTION:
What is flocculation?

ANSWER:
A process that is used to separate particles in a liquid. It is applied to particles in a colloid that aggregate into larger clumps or flocs by weak electrostatic forces. The ability of particles to flocculate relies on a surface charge on the surface of the particles. Reagents or flocculants can be added to the liquid to bring the particles together. The clumps are then able to settle under gravity or be filtered more easily. The particles can be dispersed again back into the liquid with agitation. Flocculation is used in the water treatment industry and for removing yeast from beer at the end of fermentation.

QUESTION:
Discuss your understanding of fluid mechanics.

ANSWER:
A branch of engineering science that concerns the behaviour of fluids when subjected to changes in pressure, the effects of frictional resistance, the flow through pipes, ducts, and restrictions, and the production of power. An understanding of the behaviour of fluids is critical in the cost-effective design and efficient operation of chemical plants, and includes the development and testing of theories devised to explain various phenomena. Fluid statics deals with fluids in an equilibrium state of no shear stress, whereas fluid dynamics considers fluids in relative motion. Many of the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics were established in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by scientists such as Bernoulli, Newton, and Euler. Many of today�s fluid mechanics problems are complex, nonlinear, three-dimensional, and transient. High-speed and powerful computers are increasingly used to solve complex problems particularly in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

QUESTION:
What is meant by fouling?

ANSWER:
Fouling is a deposition of solid material on a surface causing resistance to heat and mass transfer. The material may be process materials, precipitates, and particulates that build up on the surface of heat exchangers, packing supports, and distillation trays, etc. Pipe scale, lime, carbon, gums, and other chemical deposits can restrict the passage of flow, reducing heat transfer, and increasing pressure drops. Extreme fouling can cause blockages or plugging. Periodically, the process equipment must be taken out of service and cleaned. A fouling factor is a number used in heat transfer calculations where fouling is likely to be an issue on a surface causing resistance to heat transfer. Scale, dirt, and other deposits may accumulate on the heat transfer surface resulting in additional resistance to heat flow. Fouling factors are usually specified to provide a margin of safety.

QUESTION:
What is the freeboard zone?

ANSWER:
The location in a fluidized bed of solid particles in which the fluidizing gas is sufficient to form bubbles within the particles. The freeboard zone is where some particles are carried above the bed surface and are elutriated from the system while others are returned back to the bed.

QUESTION:
What is Graham�s law of diffusion?

ANSWER:
A law that states that the rates of diffusion of gases are inversely proportional to the square root of their densities under the same conditions. This was first proposed by Scottish chemist Thomas Graham (1805�69) in 1829.

QUESTION:
What is a venturi meter?

ANSWER:
A fluid flow-measuring device that consists of a tapered tube to form a throat such that the increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure, known as the venturi effect. The differential pressure produced by the flowing fluid through the throat gives a measure of the rate of flow. The pressure differential can be measured using manometers or other types of pressure measurement devices attached both upstream and at the throat. In practice, the theoretical rate of flow through the device is not achieved as friction in the device is ignored. To allow for this difference, a correction factor known as a coefficient of discharge is used. For a well-designed venturi, the coefficient lies between a value of 0.95 and 0.98. It is named after Italian physicist Giovanni Battista Venturi (1746–1822).

QUESTION:
Define total suspended solids.

ANSWER:
The amount of suspended material in water. It is a measure of the quality of water for drinking and for rivers, and is determined by filtering a volume of water through a glass fibre filter and drying it. The total suspended solids is expressed as the collected dry weight per volume of water filtered.

QUESTION:
Define total dissolved solids.

ANSWER:
The total amount of organic and inorganic substances dissolved in water. The principal constituents in fresh water are sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, sodium, and potassium cations, and carbonate and hydrogen carbonate, chloride, sulphate, and nitrate anions. It is a measure of the quality of water for drinking and for rivers. The main source of total dissolved solids is from sewers, urban sources, and agricultural surface runoff. The total dissolved solids are measured in parts per million (ppm). The World Health Organization considers drinking water to be unacceptable if the total dissolved solids content is in excess of 1,200 ppm.

QUESTION:
What is a threshold limit value?

ANSWER:
The airborne concentration of a particular substance used to define conditions under which nearly all people may be repeatedly exposed for a working lifetime without causing adverse effects. The time weighted average or TWA is the time concentration of a particular substance for an eight-hour day or 40-hour working week to which nearly all workers may be exposed. The ceiling TLV is the airborne concentration that should not be exceeded at any time.

QUESTION:
What is stratified flow?

ANSWER:
A two-phase flow regime that occurs in horizontal or slightly inclined pipes and channels where the liquid phase flows as a layer at the bottom of the channel with the gas phase above. This type of flow occurs at low gas velocities where separation of liquid and gas has occurred in which the liquid flows in the lower part of the pipe with the gas above it. At low gas velocities, the liquid–gas interface is smooth without ripples. At higher gas velocities, ripples and waves form on the liquid surface, eventually leading to the breakdown of this flow regime.

QUESTION:
What is reverse osmosis?

ANSWER:
A process in which liquid flows through a semi-permeable membrane used to separate two solutions. The most concentrated solution is a pressure above that of the osmotic pressure. This causes the liquid to flow from the more concentrated solution to the less concentrated solution. A common use of reverse osmosis is water purification from seawater.

QUESTION:
Define retention time.

ANSWER:
The time at which a certain amount of a substance has been removed or eluted from a process or process pipe. In a gas or liquid chromatograph, which is used to separate mixtures of unknown components by injection into a packed column and carried by a solvent or gas to a detector, the time for a substance to appear is measured relative to an internal standard component so that an accurate identification on the components can be made against known standards.

QUESTION:
Discuss your understanding of renewable energy.

ANSWER:
Energy derived from sources that do not deplete the Earth’s finite and non-renewable mineral resources. Examples include geothermal energy, tidal power, wave power, wind power, solar energy, biomass, biofuels, and hydroelectric power. Many others are currently being investigated due to concerns that fossil fuel reserves are running out, as well as the effects of carbon dioxide emissions from their combustion in terms of climate change. The use of renewable energy is not new. Hydropower uses kinetic energy in water flow to drive a water turbine, which in turn drives an electric generator. The first hydropower plant was open at Niagara Falls in North America in 1899. Tidal power is generated by passing water through a two-way turbine and was first used in the 1900s. Wind turbines generate electricity by using the kinetic energy of the wind to drive a set of turbine blades and thus a generator. There is no atmospheric pollution and no fuel costs. However, there is a visual impact and some noise. Wind turbines were once a common site across Europe for milling grain since the fourteenth century.

QUESTION:
What is a bubble column?

ANSWER:
A tall cylindrical vessel used for liquid-phase reactions using the sparging of a gas at the bottom to form bubbles within the liquid. The bubbles create the necessary turbulence for mixing. The surface area of the bubbles is important for mass transfer. An airlift column is a type of bubble column that has a concentric draft tube in which the bubbles rise outside the draft tube causing a liquid up-flow with the liquid flowing down the inside of the tube.

QUESTION:
What is a capillary?

ANSWER:
A tube that has a very small internal diameter. In a vertical glass capillary, the elevation of a liquid is due to surface tension forces. In a porous body, moisture held within capillaries is removed by evaporation at the surface and therefore limits the rate of drying. The rate of evaporation is therefore controlled by the movement of moisture to the surface from within the capillaries, which is dependent on surface tension, pore size, and the density of the liquid.

QUESTION:
What is a carbonation process?

ANSWER:
A general name for processes that use carbon dioxide as the reactant and involve dissolving the gas in an aqueous solution. An example is the production of calcium carbonate by passing kiln gases through an aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide.

QUESTION:
What is carbon sequestration?

ANSWER:
The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere by capture and long-term storage. In nature, trees, forests, and oceans capture carbon. Captured carbon from millennia is in the sequestered form of oil, gas, and coal located underground in oil and gas reservoirs and coal seams. Modern technologies are now being developed to capture carbon dioxide to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere in order to reduce the * greenhouse effect and control global warming.

QUESTION:
What is a no-slip boundary condition?

ANSWER:
A boundary condition assumption used in fluid mechanics that proposes that the velocity of the fluid layer in contact with a surface has the same velocity as the surface.

QUESTION:
Define mothballing.

ANSWER:
A procedure used to close a process facility for an extended period of time. The facility is shut down and left in a preserved state such that it no longer operates, but may at some future time be successfully operated again if required. All process materials are removed and the process equipment cleaned and shut down thereby preserving the equipment and preventing the effects of corrosion. Mothballing is generally used when a process is no longer economic due to loss of demand for its product. Some nuclear facilities have been mothballed due to political reasons. It is named after mothballs that were once commonly used to deter moths from eating clothes thereby preserving them.

QUESTION:
What is a molecular sieve?

ANSWER:
An absorbent and inert material such as aluminosilicate or zeolite used to remove moisture from gases or organic liquids. The absorbent has a high porosity of uniform size in the order of 4 to 5 angströms and adsorptivity at low water vapour pressures.

QUESTION:
What is molecular diffusion?

ANSWER:
A form of mass transfer in which molecules of a component in a system involving two or more components are transported from a region of high concentration to a lower concentration by random molecular motion. It is independent of any convective forces that may be present.

QUESTION:
What is a kettle reboiler?

ANSWER:
A type of horizontal shell-and-tube type heat exchanger in which liquid to be evaporated is contained on the shell side and condensing steam or a hot liquid used to provide the heat contained on the tube side. The shell contains a relatively small bundle of hairpin tubes in a two-pass arrangement in a floating head and tube sheet, and sits in a pool of the boiling liquid, the depth being determined by an overflow weir. A flow of fresh liquid continuously enters from the bottom while vapour leaves from the top of the shell. The condensing steam in the tubes is removed through a trap. Kettle reboilers are typically used with distillation columns to boil up the bottom material and return vapour back into the column for separation.

QUESTION:
What is fully developed flow.

ANSWER:
The point above a surface in which fluid flows in such a way that it has attained its final form and remains unchanged thereafter. The fluid in contact with a surface, such as in a pipe wall, is retarded to the point that it is theoretically brought to rest. Above the surface it increases in velocity to the point that it has reached the mean velocity of the bulk flow.

QUESTION:
What is meant by coalescence?

ANSWER:
The forming together of droplets of liquid that are dispersed within another liquid, such as droplets of oil within water. Coalescence can be improved by adding agents that reduce the surface tension of the droplets. A coalescer is a type of separation vessel used to separate emulsions. Baffles and filters are used to cause droplets to coalesce. Electrostatic coalescers use electric fields to cause the coalescence. Coalescers are used in the separation of oil and water, particularly in the offshore and onshore petroleum industries.

QUESTION:
What is dehydrogenation?

ANSWER:
A chemical reaction involving the removal of hydrogen from a compound. In organic molecules such as straight-chain hydrocarbons or fatty acids, single carbon–carbon bonds are converted into double bonds by the removal of hydrogen atoms.

QUESTION:
Describe the assumption of constant molal overflow in MacCabe-Thiele method for distillation column design.

ANSWER:
Constant molal overflow assumption is the substitute for the enery balances. It states that the mixture has a constant heat of vaporization and that sensible heat and heat of ixing effects are negligible. Generally, constant molal overflow assumption holds well for systems where the components are similar in nature and molecular weights, and where heat-of-solution effects are not significant.
